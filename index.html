<h1>US Campuses Crime Records from 2001 to 2014</h1>
<p class="info">Collaborators: Amir Biglari; E-Mail: amir.biglari@utah.edu; UID: U0613845. Mohsen Abbasi; E-Mail: m.abbasi@utah.edu; UID: U1011952. Waiming Tai; E-Mail: u1008421@utah.edu; UID: U1008421</p>
<p>This project is the visualization of "The Campus Safety and Security"

    data set. It consists of the statistics for different types of criminal

    activities at postsecondary institutions in the United States between 2001

    and 2014. The crimes covered in the data set are categorized into

    criminal offenses such as theft, disciplinary actions such as drug

    violations, hate crimes, VAWA offenses and others.<br/>


    The first view of this visualization is the map of United states. This map shows the ratio of the number of crimes
    in each state to the number of its students, by using a gradient color scale. By hovering over each state you'll see
    a tool tip containing general information about that specific state like number of students and number of crimes.
    Also the slider below the map can change the results on the map with respect to a desired year.<br/>

    If you choose a state the first thing that you'll see is this line chart that shows the trend of number of different
    crime types from 2001-2014 alongside of the total number of crimes. By hovering over the lines you can see their crime
    type. If you select a line, you will see a barchart showing different categories of that crime type.<br/>

    The second chart which gets updated after selecting a state is the ratio scatter plot. In this chart, each corner
    represents one of the four crime types. And as a crime type has a larger role in the total number of crimes in an institute, the said institute would be
    placed closer to the corresponding corner.<br/>

    By clicking on one of the circles on the ratio chart, the SunBurstTree chart would pop up displaying the full crime
    statistics for the university which has been selected. The first layer
    represents the crime types and the second one represents the categories in each type. by hovering over different
    pieces you can see the name and number of them. Also, by clicking on a specific type of crime, the chart gets updated.<br/>

    The last thing we have in this visualization is universities comparison. By brushing a set of universities on the
    scatter plot, the comparison table gets updated. This table can be sorted with respect to different attributes as
    well for easier and more understandable comparisons.</p>
